# A file sorting program
##	The program implements an external sorting algorithm in Java for binary data within a limited memory environment.

•	Program can sort any amount of raw data performantly, even when the unsorted data is exponentially larger than maximum computer memory. 

•	The program minimizes file I/O to remain performant via custom input and output buffers.

•	Program implements a custom minimum heap algorithm to sort records in memory as “runs.”

•	Performed multi-way merge sort to write sorted record runs to a final completely sorted result file.
